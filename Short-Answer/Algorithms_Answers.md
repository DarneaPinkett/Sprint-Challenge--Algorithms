#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This is Constant time O(1). The time or space will remain the same no matter the size of the input. Due to only one operation begin performed each time.


b)This Logarithmic Time - O(log n). The size n increases which increases the number of operations. when n is bigger the range of the loop is bigger so more operations are performed.


c)This time is Linear time - O(n) if n is bigger the then it will have more operations.
